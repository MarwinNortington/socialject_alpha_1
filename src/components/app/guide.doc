Components are independent and reusable bits of code. 
They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and returns HTML via a render function.

For example, we need a search bar across our web app. 
We CAN NOT just style a search bar again and again for every screen
--> Code waste, time-consuming and not persistent

We then must create a component to render that specific search bar.
So whenever we need to render a search bar in a screen, we just need to import 

The folder "app" contains all the components for our whole web app.
